19/05/24 - Version 3.2.0
- Important
  - Updated the teams list file with the teams from VGL22
  - The readme file has been split into a simple one in the main folder and an
    advanced one in the Engines folder, please read the simple one at least once
  - Team IDs are now also replaced on the texture filenames which have u0XXXp0
    (or u0XXXg0) on them, both in model folders and in the common folder
  - The same is done on the texture paths inside fmdl files
  - Kit textures without a mask file (srm) will get a dummy one added when
    compiling for pre-fox PES versions
    (This prevents the kits from turning black on some computers)
  - Face folders without a face_diff.bin file will get a dummy one added, which
    has the EEEE hidden, when compiling for Fox PES versions
    (This allows you to use empty face folders on players with an FBM)
    (Reminder: fpk.xml files are not needed anymore on face/boots/glove folders)
- Fixes
  - Fixed crash when updating bins without a proper "PES Folder Path" set
  - Fixed unzipping of zip and 7z exports again
  - Fixed cleaning of read-only permissions on exports for linux
  - Fixed crash when using bin files from a compressed bins cpk
  - Fixed crash when moving models from the Collars folder of the export
  - Fixed crashes caused by irregular team note txt files, to a certain extent
  - Fixed non-DX10 textures getting converted to DXT5 instead of DX10 textures
    when compiling for PES18
  - Fixed crash when handling ftex textures saved with the CGPE tool
  - Fixed crash when moving kit configs on exports which have duplicate kit
    configs with different team IDs (for some reason)
- New checks
  - Checks for any unusable .model files in the boots and glove folders,
    preventing misnamed models
  - Checks if model folders (face/boots/glove folders) contain any unrecognized
    files and warns about them
    (In the future there will be a new setting, enabled by default, which will
    turn this into an error and discard the entire model folder)
  - Checks if any compiler files are missing, and offers to "self-heal" them
    if possible
  - Checks for portrait files without powers of two as sides
  - Checks for non-2048 main kit textures on pre-fox PES versions
  - Checks if any exports have duplicate kit configs with different team IDs
  - Checks if the "Cpk Name" written on the settings file is present on the
    DpFileList file in the PES download folder
- Other new stuff
  - A new message type has been added: Info
    These are just suggestions, they let you know about stuff which will always
    work but isn't ideal, and which you can look into to improve your aesthetics
    They will be written to the new suggestions.log file
  - The missing mipmaps message is now an Info instead of a Warning
  - A new message type has been added: Fatal Error
    These happen when something is missing in the compiler's folder (for example
    the teams list) or is badly configured, so the compiler can't run
  - The error.log file is now called crash.log, and your user name will be
    removed from it every time it is generated, so that you can post it without
    doxing yourself
  - Stops asking for a button press to exit if "Run PES" is enabled
    (Unless there were any issues in the exports)
  - Stops the loggers before asking for a button press to exit
    (This prevents crashes if you run the compiler again without closing it)
  - Allows the terminal to close on error on linux systems
  - The message for indicating an old version of python is installed has been
    improved, with more details on what to do to fix the problem
  - Searches for bin files only on the cpks listed on the dpfl before the
    one you are about to compile, allowing to rebuild past midcup cpks properly
  - Converts any DX10 textures (e.g. BC7 textures) to DXT5 when compiling for
    pre-fox PES versions, like done already for PES18
  - Removes unrecognized files and folders from model folders when packing fpks
    for Fox PES versions
  - Allows pressing any key to skip error messages or exit, instead of just
    the Enter key
  - Boots and gloves are packed to the faces cpk instead of the uniform cpk
    when compiling for pre-fox PES versions, like done already for Fox versions
  - The auto-updater has been improved with a new settings transfer function,
    used when updating to a new major version, which compares the old and new
    settings files and transfers as many settings as possible, warning about
    any new settings you need to pay attention to


24/04/24 - Version 3.1.0
- Update checking is now much faster
- New auto updating system, which downloads the new version and copies your
  stuff automatically
- Now allows skipping the latest version, or disabling update checking
  directly from the compiler
- Now looks inside the midcup cpks and the faces and uniform cpk for any files
  whose path (listed on mtl and xml files) points to the common folder of the
  team, which prevents the compiler from giving errors when processing barebone
  midcup exports


23/04/24 - Version 3.0.2
- Added support for face folders with no mtl files, which would previously
  crash the compiler
- Now removes the extracted_exports folder when starting, if it is present
  because of the compiler not closing cleanly after the previous run


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.1
- Fixed crash at start when certain libraries were missing from the user's PC


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.0
- Important
  - New teams_list txt with support for the new unified database
  - Generates an error.log file after crashing, which you should provide when
    requesting support
  - Generates an issues.log file after compiling, if any of the exports had any
    issues, with the list of warnings and errors
  - Now checks mtl and xml pre-fox files for consistency, duplicated materials,
    and missing listed textures and model files
  - Now allows pre-fox folders without an xml file (xml-less) and automatically
    generates an xml with the contents of the folder, this is required for
    properly compiling the exports converted by the 4cc-aet-converter tool
- Fixes
  - Fixed unzlibbing of zlibbed textures
  - Fixed unzipping of zip and 7z exports
  - Fixed recognition of team names on exports without a Note txt
  - Fixed errors when unpacking exports with read-only files or folders
- Other new stuff
  - When a pre-fox face folder without a model set as "face_neck" is found, a
    dummy model will be copied to the folder and added to the xml, to prevent
    the default PES neck from showing up on the player
  - Will give an error if any players have a portrait both in their face folder
    and in the Portraits folder
  - A few new texture checks have been added (powers of 2, mipmaps, too small)
  - The Pes Path setting now accepts a ** magic number, which gets automatically
    replaced with the Pes Version number, eliminating the need to change both
    every time you switch versions
  - New setting for opening PES automatically after packing the cpk, disabled by
    default
  - Now suppports Note txt files in UTF8 format, weird symbols are now allowed
  - Team IDs now get replaced even in the texture paths inside mtl files,
    necessary for supporting kit-dependent player-specific textures (u0XXXp0)
  - Team IDs are also replaced in the textures' filenames themselves
  - The DDS Compression feature has been reintroduced, useful for making a full
    cup DLC that won't take 10GB on the drive
  - For Bins Updating, it will automatically grab the bin files from the latest
    midcup cpk (or the Bins cpk if none were found), eliminating the need to
    share the bin files when someone else has to make some midcup cpks
  - Now checks for updates straight from github every time it's started, with a
    cooldown of 2 hours


19/03/24 - Version 2.0.0
- Fixed some issues with packing fpk and cpk files
- Converted the main compiler runner to python to allow move_cpks to work
  properly when admin rights are needed
- Converted the settings file to ini format to allow the above to work
- Added new cache_clear setting (on by default) to allow deleting the
  patches_contents folder every time a cpk is packed


16/03/24 - Version 1.0.0
- Converted almost all of the code to python
  (Some bugs might be present, please report them with screenshots)
- Merged the fox settings into a new pes version setting
- Removed the setting for outputting compressed cpks
- Removed the module for zlibbing all the textures
- Removed the dpfl appender
  (Please never modify your dpfl)
- Updated the python version checker to have it check for 3.12+
- Updated the texture checker to have it check for the DXT type and the ftex
  version when the PES version is set to 18
