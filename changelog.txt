24/04/24 - Version 3.1.0
- Update checking is now much faster
- New auto updating system, which downloads the new version and copies your
  stuff automatically
- Now allows skipping the latest version, or disabling update checking
  directly from the compiler
- Now looks inside the midcup cpks and the faces and uniform cpk for any files
  whose path (listed on mtl and xml files) points to the common folder of the
  team, which prevents the compiler from giving errors when processing barebone
  midcup exports


23/04/24 - Version 3.0.2
- Added support for face folders with no mtl files, which would previously
  crash the compiler
- Now removes the extracted_exports folder when starting, if it is present
  because of the compiler not closing cleanly after the previous run


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.1
- Fixed crash at start when certain libraries were missing from the user's PC


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.0
- Important
  - New teams_list txt with support for the new unified database
  - Generates an error.log file after crashing, which you should provide when
    requesting support
  - Generates an issues.log file after compiling, if any of the exports had any
    issues, with the list of warnings and errors
  - Now checks mtl and xml pre-fox files for consistency, duplicated materials,
    and missing listed textures and model files
  - Now allows pre-fox folders without an xml file (xml-less) and automatically
    generates an xml with the contents of the folder, this is required for
    properly compiling the exports converted by the 4cc-aet-converter tool
- Fixes
  - Fixed unzlibbing of zlibbed textures
  - Fixed unzipping of zip and 7z exports
  - Fixed recognition of team names on exports without a Note txt
  - Fixed errors when unpacking exports with read-only files or folders
- Other new stuff
  - When a pre-fox face folder without a model set as "face_neck" is found, a
    dummy model will be copied to the folder and added to the xml, to prevent
    the default PES neck from showing up on the player
  - Will give an error if any players have a portrait both in their face folder
    and in the Portraits folder
  - A few new texture checks have been added (powers of 2, mipmaps, too small)
  - The Pes Path setting now accepts a ** magic number, which gets automatically
    replaced with the Pes Version number, eliminating the need to change both
    every time you switch versions
  - New setting for opening PES automatically after packing the cpk, disabled by
    default
  - Now suppports Note txt files in UTF8 format, weird symbols are now allowed
  - Team IDs now get replaced even in the texture paths inside mtl files,
    necessary for supporting kit-dependent player-specific textures (u0XXXp0)
  - Team IDs are also replaced in the textures' filenames themselves
  - The DDS Compression feature has been reintroduced, useful for making a full
    cup DLC that won't take 10GB on the drive
  - For Bins Updating, it will automatically grab the bin files from the latest
    midcup cpk (or the Bins cpk if none were found), eliminating the need to
    share the bin files when someone else has to make some midcup cpks
  - Now checks for updates straight from github every time it's started, with a
    cooldown of 2 hours


19/03/24 - Version 2.0.0
- Fixed some issues with packing fpk and cpk files
- Converted the main compiler runner to python to allow move_cpks to work
  properly when admin rights are needed
- Converted the settings file to ini format to allow the above to work
- Added new cache_clear setting (on by default) to allow deleting the
  patches_contents folder every time a cpk is packed


16/03/24 - Version 1.0.0
- Converted almost all of the code to python
  (Some bugs might be present, please report them with screenshots)
- Merged the fox settings into a new pes version setting
- Removed the setting for outputting compressed cpks
- Removed the module for zlibbing all the textures
- Removed the dpfl appender
  (Please never modify your dpfl)
- Updated the python version checker to have it check for 3.12+
- Updated the texture checker to have it check for the DXT type and the ftex
  version when the PES version is set to 18
